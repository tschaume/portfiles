description            automatic build tool for ROOT software
license                MIT
long_description       ckon is a C++ program/tool which automatically takes care \
                       of compilation, dictionary generation and linking of \
                       programs and libraries developed for data analyses within \
                       the CERN ROOT analysis framework. This includes parsing \
                       include headers to figure out which libraries the main \
                       programs need to be linked to. It uses automake/autoconf to \
                       be platform independent and GNU install compliant. \
                       In addition, m4 macros are automatically downloaded and \
                       the according compiler flags included based on a list of boost \
                       libraries provided in the config file. For the purpose of \
                       YAML database usage, a m4 macro can be downloaded during \
                       setup to link against the yaml-cpp library.
