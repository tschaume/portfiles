description             automatic build tool for ROOT software

long_description        ckon is a C++ program/tool which automatically takes care \
                        of compilation, dictionary generation and linking of \
                        programs and libraries developed for data analyses within \
                        the CERN ROOT analysis framework. This includes parsing \
                        include headers to figure out which libraries the main \
                        programs need to be linked to. It uses automake/autoconf to \
                        be platform independent and GNU install compliant. \
                        In addition, m4 macros are automatically downloaded and \
                        the according compiler flags included based on a list of boost \
                        libraries provided in the config file. For the purpose of \
                        YAML database usage, a m4 macro can be downloaded during \
                        setup to link against the yaml-cpp library.
